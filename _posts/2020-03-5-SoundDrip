We made an app that takes your Spotify user data and uses machine learning to craft a playlist made up of similar songs! This project was fun, challenging, and intensive. Over the past seven weeks our team of data scientists:

- Aggregated more than 700,000 songs to train our algorithm on.

- Built a machine learning algorithm to predict similar songs based off of acoustical data and metadata.

- Built out a PostgreSQL back-end hosted on AWS RDS.

- Used that backend to store user and song data for further analysis.

- Scraped additional data from Spotify's API to use with our model training.

- Migrated the entire back-end to to the suite of technologies offered on AWS, including Sagemaker, ECS and EC2, Elastic Beanstalk,     and S3.

I love seeing what teams can accomplish when they push themselves!
